Problem Statement - Pizza company name â€˜The Pizza Lounge' has decided to expand their business in future. The company is facing issues with managing & analyzing their sales data as well as understanding customer behavior.

Ultimate Goal of this project was to help company to identify their sales trends and the customer behaviour over a period of time.

Approach - Developed and implemented a comprehensive Power BI solution for analyzing pizza sales data, enabling the company to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.

Created visually appealing dashboards and reports using Power BI to track key performance indicators (KPIs), such as sales revenue, customer preferences, and regional sales trends.

Result - Conducted in-depth sales analysis using Power BI to identify key trends, patterns, customer behavior and opportunities within the sales data.





Steps Followed - The source of my data was csv files. There was 4 csv files so I loaded all the files in Power BI desktop after loading it I tranformed the files in power bi query editor to reshape and clean my data.

So here I performed some power query editor functions to clean my data like Tranform functions (use first row ad header), number functions(round),checked datatype of all columns and later remove null values from my database.

After that loaded the data in power bi desktop.

After loading I went to data modeling to create a relatioship so that it can help me to to required calculate DAX functions.
Results- Star schemea and cardinality was 1 to many.

Have attached video of my project dataset as well as dashboard and resport in the code section

After it I made use of many standard visualtions to represnt my data like clustered chart, line chart, bar chart,matrix ,slicer.
To make my reports more dynamic I made use of custom visulas as well like sunburn chart,infrographic charts,scrollers, bookmarks.
