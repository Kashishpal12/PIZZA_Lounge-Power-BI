Steps Followed - The source of my data was csv files. There was 4 csv files so I loaded all the files in Power BI desktop after loading it I tranformed the files in power bi query editor to reshape and clean my data.

So here I performed some power query editor functions to clean my data like Tranform functions (use first row ad header), number functions(round),checked datatype of all columns and later remove null values from my database.

After that loaded the data in power bi desktop.

After loading I went to data modeling to create a relatioship so that it can help me to to required calculate DAX functions.
